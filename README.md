## How to use Ninja?

Basically Ninja is a simple web browser like any others, but there are some different things you need to know:

### Custom home:

 - First login Ninja, home show as `about:blank`.

 - Use the overflow menu's __Add to home__ to pin webpages.

 - Use the overflow menu's __Relayout__ to custom your home.

 - __Long press__ on a card of home, you can edit it title.

### Switch tabs:

 - You can set tab switcher position in __screen top or screen bottom__ at `Setting/Browser/Tab Position`.

 - Press the __address bar__ and __drag it down or up__, then the fashion tab switcher will display.

 - __Swipe up/down__ to dimiss a page.

 - Or just __swipe the omnibox left/right__ to switch tab :)

The __Settings__ is located in the top or bottom left of tab switcher, the __gear__ icon.

__Remember__ that if the soft keyboard is shown the tab switcher would not works, it's our design :)

### Load in background when you click links in other App:

 1. Set Ninja as your __default browser__ when click links.

 2. __Single tap__ will open links in background, and show a clickable notification in statusbar.

 3. __Double taps__ will show a dialog that allows you to open links in foreground, etc.

### AdBlock whitelist:

Since AdBlick maybe cause some websites display error, you can add they to `Setting/AdBlock/Whitelist`.

### Readability:

Ninja support read mode but it need __the token of Readability__.

To get the token you should go to [Readability Developer APIs](https://www.readability.com/developers/api "Readability Developer APIs") to get your own token and set it in `Setting/Readability/Token`.

### Screenshot:

Ninja supports __capture entire webpage__ function.

But that is not means you could screenshot a long long long webpage(__OOM__, etc).

## Q&A:

### Where is the AdBlock's hosts.txt comes from?

We don't use the AdBlock Plus' Easylist.

The `hosts.txt` comes from [hpHosts](http://hosts-file.net/ad_servers.txt "hpHosts").

### Why no incognito mode?

Incognito mode is a necessary feature for a web browser, but since `WebView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyleAttr, boolean privateBrowsing)` was __deprecated__ in API level 17 and no longer supported, the incognito mode is __conflict__ with our UI design, so we stop it(but maybe restart to develop it someday). If you want to add incognito mode you can fork our sourse code and do it by yourself :)

### Why not Google Play?
